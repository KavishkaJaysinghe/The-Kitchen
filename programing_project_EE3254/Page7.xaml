            SELLE V1.01, a groundbreaking desktop application, marks the culmination of our undergraduate project in desktop application development. Spearheaded by D G K Jayasinghe (Registration Number: EG/2021/4578) and in collaboration with  Dissanayaka P R S K (Registration Number: EG/2021/4492), SELLE V1.01 emerges as a beacon of innovation in the realm of Point of Sale (POS) systems.
            Our project falls under the category of Point of Sale systems, focusing on revolutionizing cashier systems for restaurants. Aptly named "THE kitchen," our software aims to streamline and enhance the dining experience for both customers and restaurant staff. Through intuitive user interface design and leveraging the power of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), we've crafted a solution that transcends traditional POS systems.
